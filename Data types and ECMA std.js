/* Notes
 The alert dialog should be used for messages which do not require any response on the part of the user, other than the acknowledgement of the message.

 Dialog boxes are modal windows - they prevent the user from accessing the rest of the program's interface until the dialog box is closed. For this reason, you should not overuse any function that creates a dialog box (or modal window). */
